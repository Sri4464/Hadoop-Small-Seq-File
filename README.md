# Hadoop-Small-Seq-File
Java code to convert small files to sequence files
Use case: Multiple small files were being generated by sqoop during the Import which of size less that 500KB, and millions of such files were generated daily. This jar program uses the small files --> file name as key and contents as values to create small files.

##### This is only a templete of the program
